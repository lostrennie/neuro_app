		<h4 class="hub_para">FSU Neuroscience Involvement & Outreach</h4>

		<p class="hub_para">The North Florida Neuroscience Group re-activated its chapter in 2004. Since then, the Program in Neuroscience at FSU has developed several neuroscience community outreach activities. The Outreach and Education Sub-Committe (OES) at FSU was established to engage in public outreach activities including the annual Brain Awareness Week, North Florida Brain Bee, and various Student Research Mentoring Programs.</p>

		<p class="hub_para">CNEC's mission is to enhance local community knowledge about brain research with a direct goal of promoting public neuroscience education in K-12 students. To this end, CNEC is committed to both academic and civic responsibility through three primary aims:</p>

		<p class="hub_para">
			 <ol class="hub_para">
			 	<li>Educate local and statewide K-12 students about the importance of brain research.</li>
			 	<li>Encourage K-12 educators to incorporate neuroscience curriculum into their classroom.</li>
			 	<li>Train and inspire talented high school/college students to pursue Neuroscience-related careers.</li>
			 </ol>
