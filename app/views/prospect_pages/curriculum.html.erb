Details on the Program in Neuroscience Curriculum may be found in the Graduate Student Handbook.[LINK]

Students entering our program immediately begin working on research in the laboratory of their chosen major professor.  First and second-year students take a series of required courses, and then there are a number of electives from which students may choose to complete their individual programs of study.

Required Courses

PCB 5845: Cell and Molecular Neuroscience

PSB 5341: Systems and Behavioral Neuroscience

PSB 5230C: Comparative Neuroanatomy with Laboratory

PSB 5057: Neuroscience Methods (aka Molecules to Behavior)

PSB 5077: Responsible Conduct of Research

PSY 6919: Research Design and Analysis (or equivalent)

Directed Individual Study: Two laboratory rotations, in addition to major professorâ€™s laboratory, are required
